# Rotor-propeller-design
## Application of Blade Element Momentum Theory
### A computer program to implement BEM Theory
* Version 1: Without the Prandtl Tip Loss model
* Version 2: With the Prandtl Tip Loss model (will require iterative solving)
The program is able to solve for both, rotors and propellers by setting linear twist, linear taper, and root cut-outs.
